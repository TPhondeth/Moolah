# MOOLAH

## Description

Moolah is envisioned as a focal point for all the information related to cryptocurrencies - historical data, market capitalization, blockchain features, etc.. Moolah offers its users the option to select from a range of cryptocurrencies and add them to their personal account.

- In its current state, Moolah works as a portal that disseminates "crypto-knowledge", i.e., it gathers information using APIs and presents it to the users.
- In future iterations, Moolah will act as a 'one-stop-shop' for cryptocurrencies: it will provide links to tutorials/courses(for users interested in getting an insight into the blockchain technology), cryptocurrency news portals, among other features.
